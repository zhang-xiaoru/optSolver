This repository contains all required components for the project.
1. Complete Software Package (all algorithm implementations)
The full optimization framework is implemented inside:
(1) src/
Contains the core implementation of all algorithms (Gradient Descent, Modified Newton, Newton–CG, BFGS, DFP, L-BFGS), line-search routines, stopping criteria, and problem definitions.
(2) optimizer.py
Provides the unified interface
optSolver-OptimizationHunters(problem, method, options)
and wraps all algorithm-level logic.
This is the main entry point used by all experiment scripts.
(3) testing/
Includes test problems, helper utilities, and verification functions used during development.
Together, these files constitute the complete software package required by the assignment.
2. Script that runs all experiments in “Table: Summary of Results”
(1) make_summary_table.py
This script executes all algorithms on the twelve benchmark problems and records:
– iteration counts
– function/gradient evaluations
– CPU time
– final accuracy metrics
The script outputs summary_table.csv, which directly corresponds to the "Summary of Results" table in the report.
(2) plot_results.py
Takes the experiment outputs and generates the convergence plots shown in the report.
(3) summary_table.csv
The raw results generated by make_summary_table.py.
These files collectively reproduce the results in the Summary Table section.
3. Additional files for extended experiments
LBFGS_memory.py and LBFGS_memory2.py
Scripts used to conduct memory-sweep experiments for L-BFGS and generate the figures in the Memory Study section.
